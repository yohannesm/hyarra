#summary The basic description and advantage of this Array class

= Introduction =
We implement an stack-allocated array object.


==implementation==
 ===Constructor===
There are two constructors, one that initialize the array of size N with N element,the other that constructs the array by using some sequences from an input iterator.
 ===operator[]===
reference operator [] that gets an element inside the array container.
const_reference operator [] that gets a constant reference of an element inside the array container.
 ===at===
reference at to get the element of the Array at the specified index.
const_reference at to get the element of the Array at the specified index.
 ===iterator===
iterator begin that returns an iterator to the beginning of the Array.
const_iterator that returns a constant  iterator to the beginning of the Array.
iterator end that returns an iterator to the end of the Array.
const_iterator end that returns a constant iterator to the end of the Array.
 ===size===
size_type size that returns the size of the stack allocated array.
 ===print===
It prints the array.
==Advantage of using this array==
1.It is stack-allocated array. 
2.we can use an assignment 
3.we can use an constructor. 
4.we can use array STL algorithm.
Therefore, comparing to the regular array provided in c++, we can use more functions than from regular array.
